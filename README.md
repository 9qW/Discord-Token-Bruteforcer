# Discord-Token-Bruteforcer

This requires for you to know the ID of the discord user.
By using this ID and encoding it into a base64, you can make the bruteforce simpler and you can access a specific discord account after bruteforcing.
Happy hunting...

If you couldn't figure out, unless you have a supercomputer its going to be quite a LONG time before you randomly generate a correct token.
